pokeapi-dex
===================

v1 of Pokedex using AngularJS and MaterializeCSS.

This app uses [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/docsv2/), a free and open to use Pokemon API that spans generations 1-7.

Here's a link to the [latest version](https://pokeapi-dex-v1.herokuapp.com/www/index.html)!
(If the site doesn't load Pokemon in a couple of seconds, the API may unfortunately be down atm :sweat:)
